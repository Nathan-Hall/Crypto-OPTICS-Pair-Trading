## Explanation
- Implementation of Sarmento (2020) "Enhancing a Pairs Trading strategy with the application of Machine Learning"
- Gets 5-minute data of all Cryptos on Binance which have data going back over the data testing period. (This is alot of data and takes quite a while to run)
- Saves retrieved data to an excel
- Splits data in test and training datasets
- Applies PCA and OPTICS to find clusters of cryptos (cryptos that move together)
- Uses AD Fuller Test to test for cointegation, then tests for hurst exponent, half-life, mean crossings to ensure that pairs are valid

## Still to do
- Sadly this is a big project and there's still alot of work to do
- I have to re-verify the pairs in the test set, to make sure they are viable in both train and test sets
- Have to implement some type of trading system on the found data
- Have to find some way to speed up data collection process
- Most importantly, I have to clean up to code as it is quite messy (sorry)
